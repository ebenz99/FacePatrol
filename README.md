This program is intended to keep the office pranksters off your laptop.

## Overview

First, credit to Hayden Riewe's LockAway Repo that can be found here: 'https://github.com/hriewe/LockAway' --much of this idea comes from that.

## How To Run

Hopefully pretty simple. To run:
1. First install all the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt with pip.
2. Run "face-trainer.py" to prep
3. Run "Protector.py" as you leave the room
